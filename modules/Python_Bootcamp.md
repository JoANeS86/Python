I can use lstrip(), rstrip() and strip() to remove spaces and the start or at the end, and in case I want to remove a different character, I'll need to add it between the parenthesis (e.g., strip("#")).

I can also uses those methods combined with len(), to review the number of white spaces in a large text.

Methods upper() and lower() are used to return characters in upper or lower case; startswith(), endswith(), find() and in are used to search for something; and isalpha() and isnumeric() are used to check and validate the content of our string.
