      Hard-coded (static) value: Fixed piece of data written directly into your code that never changes at runtime.

      Dynamic value: Data entered by the user that can vary each time the program runs.

- Course 7: Data types

  Functions vs Methods:

I can use lstrip(), rstrip() and strip() to remove spaces and the start or at the end, and in case I want to remove a different character, I'll need to add it between the parenthesis (e.g., strip("#")).

I can also uses those methods combined with len(), to review the number of white spaces in a large text.

Methods upper() and lower() are used to return characters in upper or lower case; startswith(), endswith(), find() and in are used to search for something; and isalpha() and isnumeric() are used to check and validate the content of our string.

If a number is as a string data type, and you multiply it by 3, python will repeat the number 3 times rather than actually multiplying it by 3.

Some few notes about operators:

            Operator "//" it divides two numbers and rounds down.
            Operator "%" will return the leftover after a division (used to check if a number is even).
            Operator "**" acts as exponentiation.

Round() uses banker's rounding, which rounds .5 to the nearest even number.

- Course 10:

<ins>Control Flow</ins>: It's the logic you write to control how your code runs.
