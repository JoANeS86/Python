#### Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

<ins>Object-Oriented Programming</ins>: A programming system that is based around objects, which can contain both data and
code that manipulates that data.

<ins>Object</ins>: An instance of a class; a fundamental building block of Python.

<ins>Class</ins>: A class is an object's data type that bundles data and functionality together. In other words, the reason why
it's useful for an object to have a type – or belong to a class – is because it allows us to build a bunch of useful tools that
can be packed directly into the object itself.

    Core Python Classes are:
        
        Integers
        Floats
        Strings
        Booleans
        Lists
        Dictionaries
        Tuples
        Sets
        Frozensets
        Functions
        Ranges
        None
        Custom Defined

<ins>Method</ins>: A function that belongs to a class and typically performs an action or operation. Most coding environments
have ways to access a list of methods available to a given class (E.g., In Jupyter Notebook, we type dot and then hit the tab key).

Methods are followed by parentheses, and it's possible for them to take arguments.

<ins>Attribute</ins>: A value associated with an object or class which is referenced by name using dot notation.

A simpler way of thinking about the distinction between attributes and methods is to remember that attributes are *characteristics*
of the object, while methods are *actions* or *operations*.
